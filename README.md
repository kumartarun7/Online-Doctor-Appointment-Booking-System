# Online Doctor Appointment Booking System

This project is an online platform designed to facilitate booking appointments with doctors. Users can register as either doctors or patients. Doctors can create profiles and list their availability, while patients can search for doctors and book appointments based on their requirements. The system handles secure payments through Stripe and stores data using MongoDB. Firebase is utilized for image storage. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, while the backend functionalities are implemented using JavaScript.
